### Necessary configurations:
1. download and install `node.js`
1. create `config.json` in
![alt text](https://github.com/594-666/goshxt/blob/main/demo.png?raw=true) 
1. add the below content to `config.json`:

```
{
    "student_id": "",
    "password": "",
    "fullauto": true,
    "time": "2024-12-20 12:30"
}
```  
What are these attributes used for?
-  `student_id`: your id.
-  `password`: your password.
-  `headless`: any falsy/truthy value in javascript
   -  true: the browser window will not present, vice versa.
- `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm`: the time the systems opens
  - this can actually be in any valid format if you know how to do, see: [Date.parse()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse)
  - otherwise, please make sure the format fits.

- `manual`: will be explained later.  

(basically you only need to fill-in the `id`, `password` and`time`)

### Work flow explained  

This script will first lead you to the website and login with the `id` and `password` you provided.  
Then switch to the ![pre schedule btn](https://github.com/594-666/goshxt/blob/main/pre_schedule.png?raw=true) page.  
It'll see if the moment you run this script is before the system open.  
If it is, The script will run the course adding part right after the system opened.  
If not, it'll start adding immediately.  
And there's a listener for `'dialog'` event, this script will accept any dialogs.

**Important:**  
this script simply try clicking every available ![alt text](https://github.com/594-666/goshxt/blob/main/add_btn.png?raw=true) button from your pre-schedule list  
**For the best case, please *DO NOT* make any *clashes* in your pre-schedule list.**

### The `manual` option

- `false`(default):  
This script will add the courses for you.
- `true`  
This script will only login and lead you to the ![pre schedule btn](https://github.com/594-666/goshxt/blob/main/pre_schedule.png?raw=true) page.  
All the dialogs will be accepted immediately.  
So you can quickly go through the courses and add them, no need to click the noisy dialogs.  
![alt text](https://github.com/594-666/goshxt/blob/main/dialog.png?raw=true)  
(as the trade off, you won't be able to immediately know whether the course is successfully added)
